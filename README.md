# üí≥ CreditWise: Smart Credit Score Predictor

A Streamlit application leveraging a sophisticated pre-trained Stacking Classifier model to predict customer credit scores (Poor, Standard, or Good) based on user-provided, transformed financial data. This project showcases a complete machine learning pipeline from exploratory data analysis and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Interactive Web Interface**: A user-friendly and interactive web application built with Streamlit for seamless credit score prediction.
*   **Advanced Predictive Model**: Utilizes a robust Stacking Classifier, identified as the top-performing model, to deliver highly accurate credit score predictions.
*   **Comprehensive Data Pipeline**: Includes extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), outlier detection, intelligent missing value imputation, and feature engineering.
*   **Data Transformation**: Applies log and Yeo-Johnson transformations to reduce skewness in numerical features, enhancing model performance.
*   **Categorical Credit Score Output**: Predicts credit scores clearly categorized as 'Poor', 'Standard', or 'Good'.
*   **Prediction Confidence**: Provides transparency by displaying probability scores for each credit category, indicating the model's certainty.
*   **Modular Model Integration**: The application loads a pre-trained model, allowing for easy updates and improvements to the underlying machine learning logic.
*   **Model Evaluation**: Benchmarks various classification models including Logistic Regression, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and ensemble methods (Stacking, Soft Voting).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **Python**: The core programming language for the entire project.
*   **Streamlit**: For creating the interactive and dynamic web application interface.
*   **Pandas**: Essential for efficient data loading, manipulation, and analysis.
*   **NumPy**: Used for high-performance numerical operations and array manipulation.
*   **Scikit-learn**: The primary library for machine learning models, data preprocessing (e.g., `PowerTransformer`), and evaluation metrics.
*   **Plotly**: For generating interactive data visualizations during EDA.
*   **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For creating static and statistical data visualizations.
*   **Tabulate**: Used for presenting model performance metrics in a clear, tabular format.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To set up this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/CreditWise-Predictor.git
    cd CreditWise-Predictor
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `your-username/CreditWise-Predictor` with the actual repository URL if known.)*

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment** (Recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project root with the following content:
    ```
    streamlit
    pandas
    numpy
    scikit-learn
    plotly
    seaborn
    matplotlib
    tabulate
    ```
    Then, install these dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Obtain the Model File**:
    Ensure the `final_stacking_model.pkl` file is present in the project root directory. This file contains the trained machine learning model and necessary data transformation objects. It is generated by running the `credit-score-classification.ipynb` notebook.

## üöÄ Usage

Once the installation is complete and the model file is in place, you can launch and interact with the Credit Score Prediction application:

1.  **Run the Streamlit App**:
    Execute the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    streamlit run F.py
    ```

2.  **Access the Application**:
    The application will automatically open in your default web browser (typically at `http://localhost:8501`). If it doesn't, copy the local URL provided in your terminal and paste it into your browser.

3.  **Input Data**:
    *   Navigate to the sidebar on the left to find input fields for various customer attributes.
    *   **Important**: This application expects **pre-transformed numerical values** for features such as `Age`, `Monthly_Inhand_Salary`, `Num_Credit_Inquiries`, `Interest_Rate`, `Num_of_Delayed_Payment`, `Total_EMI_per_month`, and `Amount_invested_monthly`. These values should be the output of the data transformation steps (e.g., log transformation, Yeo-Johnson) performed during the initial data preprocessing.
    *   Select the appropriate categories for `Month`, `Occupation`, and `Payment of Minimum Amount` from their respective dropdown menus.

4.  **Get Prediction**:
    After entering all the required data, click the "Predict Credit Score" button. The main section of the application will display:
    *   The predicted credit score (e.g., "Good", "Standard", or "Poor").
    *   A bar chart illustrating the model's confidence (probability) for each credit score category.
